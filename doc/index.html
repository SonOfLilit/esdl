    <h3> ESDL Introduction </h3>
    <p>
      ESDL is an api which invokes corresponding functions in the
      Sdl and Opengl libraries. 
    </p>
    
    <p> Since most of the functions are 1 to 1 mapping to the original
      libraries, the descriptions (if any) are brief. For detailed 
      descriptions and manual pages take a look at the 
      <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.opengl.org"> Opengl </a> sites which should 
      be able guide you to the documentation. I have tried to generate link 
      to the descriptions on net, but may have failed in some cases.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With some common sense you should be able to figure out the arguments 
      and return values to the functions. Arguments in the 'C' libraries that
      are used as out parameters, are often returned as a tuple with values.      
      C functions that take pointer to an array as argument takes a list 
      as argument in erlang (and/or tuple).
    </p>
    
    <p> The thing that differs are of course the memory handling and 
      memory references, check out the examples.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      If you have complaints of non trivial (or errors) arguments or return values,
      send me an email and I'll try to update the documentation or  (the fast way) 
      check the source.
    </p>

    <h3>OpenGL</h3>    
    <p>
      Opengl functions that uses pointers requires
      that you use the memory functions in <a href="sdl_util.html">sdl_util</a> 
      to handle the memory references.
